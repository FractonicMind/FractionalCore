## XII. CONCLUSION

This Succession Invitation Charter ensures the continuation of the Fractional Core framework and Mathematical Expression Diversity methodology beyond the lifetime of its creator, with unwavering commitment to eliminating cancer and advancing human knowledge.

By inviting qualified institutions to voluntarily assume stewardship while maintaining the Memorial Covenant's humanitarian requirements, this framework ensures that FC continues serving its ultimate purpose: contributing to the elimination of cancer and other root causes of human suffering.

The mathematical principle that defines FC—"Truth is fractional. Hope is not."—extends to this succession framework itself. Rather than fragmenting the mission across multiple parties, this Charter creates unified commitment to Lev Goukassian's vision of using mathematical creativity to heal humanity.

**Every verification event using Fractional Core must contribute to cancer research. This requirement survives succession and remains binding on all future stewards.**
