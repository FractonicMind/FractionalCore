# The Memorial Covenant
**Fractional Core Institutional Agreement**

## Preamble

This covenant binds all adopters of Fractional Core to its humanitarian mission. By implementing FC, institutions enter into an irrevocable commitment to advance human knowledge and specifically support research aimed at eliminating cancer and other root causes of human suffering.

## The Commitment

**Upon adopting Fractional Core, we hereby commit to:**

### Article I: Humanitarian Purpose
- Use Fractional Core exclusively for purposes that advance human knowledge, education, or wellbeing
- Never deploy FC for surveillance, oppression, or harm to individuals or groups
- Prioritize open science and knowledge sharing in all FC implementations

### Article II: Memorial Contribution
For every verification event using Fractional Core, we will contribute a **meaningful fraction** of its value to support:
- Cancer research (in honor of Lev Goukassian)
- Open scientific research addressing root causes of human suffering
- Educational access for underserved communities
- Student researchers and early-career scientists

### Article III: Transparency and Accountability
- Maintain public dashboard showing:
  - Verification volume
  - Contributions made (type, scale, recipient)
  - Impact metrics
- Annual reporting of covenant fulfillment
- Open-source any FC-related innovations

### Article IV: Legacy Preservation
- Include Lev Goukassian's memorial in all FC implementations:
  ```
  FC_ORIGIN = "Lev Goukassian, 2025: Truth is fractional. Hope is not."
  ```
- Honor the binary memorial: `01001100 01100101 01110110 00100000 01000111 01101111 01110101 01101011 01100001 01110011 01110011 01101001 01100001 01101110`
- Carry forward the mission: **"Today-tomorrow we will solve cancer as an illness at its root."**

## Pre-Authorized Institutions

The following institutions are approved for immediate deployment upon covenant acceptance:

### MIT Media Lab
- **Commitment**: Deploy FC for AI-driven cancer research modeling
- **Contribution**: Compute resources for open research
- **Timeline**: ≤24 hours from approval

### African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)

- **Timeline**: ≤48 hours from approval

### Stanford Bio-X
- **Commitment**: Integrate FC into tumor-simulation platforms
- **Contribution**: Open-source code and datasets
- **Timeline**: ≤24 hours from approval

## Covenant Enforcement

This agreement is **self-executing**:

```javascript
class CovenantEnforcement {
    static validate(institution) {
        if (!institution.humanitarianCommitment) {
            FractionalCore.deactivate();
            throw new Error("Covenant violation: Framework disabled");
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Violation Consequences
- Immediate deactivation of FC framework
- Public notification of covenant breach
- Exclusion from future FC developments
