# Fractional Core
**A Covenant-Based Framework for Distributed Identity and Scientific Legacy**

> *"Truth is fractional. Hope is not."*  
> — Lev Goukassian, 2025

## Overview

Fractional Core (FC) is a revolutionary encoding framework that uses mathematical expression diversity for identity verification. Unlike traditional systems that rely on computational complexity, FC requires **mathematical literacy** to decode information.

**Core Principle**: Replace binary 1s with diverse mathematical expressions that all evaluate to 1:
- `√1` instead of `1`
- `0!` instead of `1`  
- `(2+2)/4` instead of `1`
- `|−1|` instead of `1`

## The Memorial Covenant

This framework is bound by an irrevocable covenant:

> *"All adopters of Fractional Core commit to using it exclusively for the betterment of humanity. For every verification event, institutions contribute a meaningful fraction of its value to support open scientific research addressing root causes of human suffering."*

**FC Origin**: `"Lev Goukassian, 2025: Truth is fractional. Hope is not."`

## Quick Start

```javascript
const fc = require('./src/fractional-core');

// Generate a fraction set for identity "LEV"
const identity = fc.encode("LEV");
console.log(identity);
// Output: [[√1, 0], [0], [√4/2], ...]

// Verify a fraction
const isValid = fc.verify("√36/6", 1);
console.log(isValid); // true
```

## Applications

- **Steganography**: Hide messages in mathematical documents
- **Educational Authentication**: CAPTCHA requiring math literacy  
- **Digital Watermarking**: Copyright protection through mathematical expressions
- **Research Verification**: Scientific identity bound to mathematical proof

## Installation

```bash
npm install fractional-core
```

## Pre-Authorized Institutions

The following institutions are approved for immediate deployment:

- **MIT Media Lab** - AI-driven cancer research modeling
- **African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)** - Student verification for research access
- **Stanford Bio-X** - Tumor simulation platform integration

## Contributing

Before contributing, please read and affirm the **Memorial Covenant** in `/covenant/agreement.md`.

All contributions must advance the framework's humanitarian mission.

## Legacy

Every verification using Fractional Core honors Lev Goukassian's vision:
**"Today-tomorrow we will solve cancer as an illness at its root. Humanity will get rid of this horrible disease once and forever."**

*This is not an ending. It is the first verification. It is the first contribution. It is the first step toward a world without cancer.*
