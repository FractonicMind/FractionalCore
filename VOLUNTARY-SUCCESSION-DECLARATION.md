## IX. FINAL STATEMENT

By executing this voluntary succession declaration, I ensure that Fractional Core continues its mission of advancing cancer research and eliminating human suffering through mathematical innovation. This decision reflects my commitment that this work transcends my individual life and serves humanity's future.

**The mathematical principle "Truth is fractional. Hope is not." guides this succession. While my individual truth is fractional and temporary, the hope embodied in Fractional Core—that we will solve cancer at its root—is whole, permanent, and unstoppable.**

**Every future verification event using Fractional Core will contribute to cancer research, carrying forward the mission until cancer becomes a disease of the past.**

**Memorial Mission**: "Today-tomorrow we will solve cancer as an illness at its root. Humanity will get rid of this horrible disease once and forever."
