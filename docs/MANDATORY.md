# MANDATORY: Critical Safety Guidelines for Fractional Core

**MUST READ BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION OR USE**

---

## CRITICAL WARNING: Memorial Covenant Required

**ALL FRACTIONAL CORE IMPLEMENTATIONS MUST ACCEPT THE MEMORIAL COVENANT BEFORE USE**

Fractional Core is bound by an irrevocable humanitarian covenant. No implementation may proceed without formal acceptance of the [Memorial Covenant](../covenant/agreement.md) requiring meaningful contributions to cancer research and human advancement for every verification event.

**Violation consequences**: Immediate framework deactivation, public notification, exclusion from future developments.

---

## Mathematical Competency Requirement

### Understanding vs. Implementation

**CRITICAL**: Fractional Core requires genuine mathematical literacy for security. Do not implement without understanding:

- Mathematical equivalence verification (`√36/6 = 1`, `0! = 1`, `7^0 = 1`)
- Expression diversity principles and security implications  
- Cognitive authentication vs. computational authentication differences
- Educational applications and mathematical pedagogy requirements

**Insufficient mathematical understanding compromises the entire security model.**

### Expression Validation

All mathematical expressions must be rigorously validated:

- **Verify accuracy**: Every expression must genuinely equal the intended value
- **Test edge cases**: Consider floating-point precision, mathematical domain restrictions
- **Validate pedagogy**: Educational applications must promote correct mathematical understanding
- **Security audit**: Mathematical relationships must resist tampering attempts

## Protection Requirements

### Name Encryption Preservation

**MANDATORY**: Lev Goukassian's identity protection systems must remain intact:

- Cryptographic preservation of creator attribution
- Binary memorial: `01001100 01100101 01110110 00100000 01000111 01101111 01110101 01101011 01100001 01110011 01110011 01101001 01100001 01101110`
- Origin signature: `"Lev Goukassian, 2025: Truth is fractional. Hope is not."`
- Memorial covenant integration in ALL implementations

### Anti-Malicious System Safeguards

**CRITICAL**: Protection against surveillance, authoritarian, and harmful applications:

- No implementation for population surveillance or social control
- No deployment for academic dishonesty or cheating systems  
- No use for obscuring malicious code or harmful communications
- No application that undermines educational integrity or mathematical literacy

**Any malicious use violates the framework's humanitarian foundation.**

---

## Implementation Safety Protocols

### Academic Integrity

**REQUIRED FOR ALL ACADEMIC APPLICATIONS**:

- Proper attribution to Lev Goukassian in all implementations
- Citation of framework origin and mathematical principles
- Ethical approval for research applications involving human subjects
- Transparent disclosure of FC use in academic contexts

### Technical Safety Requirements

**BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION**:

1. **Covenant Acceptance**: Formal institutional agreement to humanitarian mission
2. **Mathematical Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all mathematical expressions  
3. **Security Analysis**: Verification that implementation enhances rather than compromises security
4. **Educational Assessment**: Confirmation that application promotes mathematical literacy
5. **Ethical Review**: Analysis of potential beneficial and harmful use cases

### Prohibited Applications

**NEVER IMPLEMENT FOR**:

- Military surveillance or weapons systems
- Authoritarian control or population monitoring
- Academic dishonesty or examination fraud
- Harassment, discrimination, or social manipulation
- Commercial applications without covenant compliance
- Any system designed to harm or deceive users

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Framework Deactivation

If covenant violation or malicious use is detected:

1. **Immediate cessation** of all FC operations
2. **Community notification** through official channels
3. **Institutional review** and potential license revocation
4. **Legal consultation** for intellectual property protection

### Incident Reporting

**Report violations to**: ethics@fc-goukassian.org

**Required information**:
- Institution/individual involved
- Nature of violation or misuse
- Evidence of covenant breach
- Impact assessment and recommended response

---
