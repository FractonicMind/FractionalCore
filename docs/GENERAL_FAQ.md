# Fractional Core General FAQ

**Comprehensive Technical Questions and Answers**

*47 Essential Questions Covering Mathematical Foundations, Implementation, and Applications*

---

## Mathematical Foundations

### Q1: What is the core mathematical principle behind Fractional Core?

**A**: Fractional Core is based on **Mathematical Expression Diversity** - the principle that any mathematical truth can be expressed in infinite ways. For example, the value 1 can be represented as √1, 0!, 7^0, (2+2)/4, |−1|, and countless other mathematically equivalent expressions. Instead of using simple binary 1s and 0s, FC uses this diversity to create encoded information that requires mathematical literacy to decode.

### Q2: Why do all expressions need to equal 1?

**A**: The value 1 serves as the universal "true" state in FC's encoding system, replacing the binary 1. This creates a mathematically elegant system where:
- 0 remains 0 (false/empty)
- 1 is expressed through diverse mathematical expressions
- The encoded result looks like mathematical homework rather than encrypted data
- Mathematical literacy becomes the key to understanding the encoded information

### Q3: How many different expressions equal 1?

**A**: Mathematically infinite. Basic examples include:
- **Algebraic**: √1, √4/2, √9/3, √16/4, √25/5, √36/6
- **Factorial**: 0!, 1!/1!, 2!/2!
- **Exponential**: 1^n (any n), n^0 (any n≠0)  
- **Trigonometric**: sin²θ + cos²θ, tan(π/4)
- **Arithmetic**: (n+n)/2n, (n-n)+1, n/n (n≠0)
- **Complex**: e^(2πi), |e^(iθ)|

### Q4: What mathematical knowledge is required to use FC?

**A**: **Basic Level**: Understanding arithmetic, square roots, factorials, absolute values, and exponents. **Advanced Level**: For sophisticated applications, knowledge of trigonometry, complex numbers, and calculus enhances the available expression diversity. The system is designed to be accessible to anyone with high school mathematics.

### Q5: How does FC handle floating-point precision issues?

**A**: FC uses tolerance-based verification (typically ±0.0001) to handle floating-point precision. For critical applications, exact rational arithmetic or symbolic computation ensures perfect accuracy. The framework includes built-in precision handling for common mathematical expressions.

## Memorial Covenant and Humanitarian Mission

### Q6: What is the Memorial Covenant and why is it mandatory?

**A**: The Memorial Covenant is an irrevocable humanitarian commitment binding all FC implementations. It requires that every verification event contributes meaningfully to cancer research and human advancement. Created by Lev Goukassian during his battle with Stage 4 cancer, the covenant ensures FC serves humanity's highest purposes rather than commercial exploitation alone.

### Q7: How do I accept the Memorial Covenant?

**A**: Covenant acceptance requires:
```javascript
const covenantAgreement = {
    humanitarianCommitment: true,
    cancerResearchSupport: true,
    openScienceCommitment: true,
    institutionName: "Your Institution",
    contributionPlan: "Specific contribution description"
};
fc.acceptCovenant("Institution-ID", covenantAgreement);
```
Without covenant acceptance, the FC framework will not function.

### Q8: What constitutes a "meaningful contribution" to cancer research?

**A**: Contributions are institution-defined but must be proportional to FC usage:
- **Research institutions**: Computational resources, data sharing, research funding
- **Educational organizations**: Scholarships, mathematical literacy programs
- **Commercial users**: Financial contributions, pro bono services, open-source development
- **Individual researchers**: Community contributions, educational materials, citation and attribution

### Q9: How is covenant compliance monitored?

**A**: Through multiple mechanisms:
- **Code-level enforcement**: Framework deactivation for non-compliance
- **Community monitoring**: Public reporting and peer review
- **Institutional oversight**: Annual compliance reporting
- **Transparent tracking**: Public dashboard of contributions and impact

### Q10: Can the Memorial Covenant be modified or removed?

**A**: **No**. The Memorial Covenant is permanently embedded in FC's legal and technical structure. It survives succession, institutional changes, and technology evolution. Any attempt to remove or weaken the covenant violates the framework's fundamental purpose.

### Q13: What are the performance implications of FC?

**A**: **Encoding**: Slightly slower than binary due to expression generation. **Verification**: Fast - simple mathematical computation. **Storage**: Larger than binary but more human-readable. **Network**: Increased bandwidth for mathematical expressions vs. simple bits. Overall performance suitable for most applications except ultra-high-frequency systems.

### Q14: How scalable is FC for large systems?

**A**: **Highly scalable**:

- Community notification and public reporting
- Legal action for intellectual property violation
- Exclusion from future FC development and support

### Q19: How does FC protect against automated attacks?

**A**: **Mathematical literacy requirement**: Automated systems need genuine mathematical understanding, not just pattern recognition. **Expression diversity**: Infinite variation prevents simple lookup tables. **Educational integration**: Legitimate use promotes learning rather than exploitation.

### Q20: Can FC be used for surveillance or authoritarian purposes?

**A**: **Explicitly prohibited** by the Memorial Covenant. FC's educational and mathematical literacy focus inherently opposes surveillance applications. Technical and legal safeguards prevent authoritarian deployment.
